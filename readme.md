## GENERAL
This is a fork of an AI program for the card game [Race for the Galaxy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-galaxy), designed by [Tom Lehmann](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/150/thomas-lehmann). The [AI program](https://github.com/bnordli/rftg) was originally developed by [Keldon Jones](http://keldon.net/rftg), and later improved by B. Nordli and J.-R. Reinhard. 

This fork fixes a minor compilation issue with the Mac OS X version 0.9.5, featuring the Xeno Invasion expansion implemented by [Marsux](https://github.com/Marsux).
